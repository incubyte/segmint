# Backend Framework for Segmint

## Introduction
Segmint is a Personalized AI Content Engine by Incubyte, designed to help creators and brands craft meaningful, tailored content by deeply understanding their unique voice and evolution. This document outlines the backend framework specification of the Segmint web application, developed using Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.

## 1. API Architecture and Endpoints Organization

### RESTful API Design Patterns
- **Endpoint Structure:** 
  - Base URL: `/api/v1`
  - Use nouns for endpoint paths to represent resources.
  - Use HTTP methods to define actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Naming Conventions
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/users`: User management
  - `/content`: Content generation and management
  - `/integration`: Social media integrations
  - `/workflow`: Approval workflows
  - `/ideas`: AI-powered idea suggestions

### Request/Response Formats
- **JSON format** for both requests and responses.
- **Example:**
  ```json
  POST /api/v1/content
  {
    "text": "Sample content text",
    "tone": "friendly"
  }
  ```

### Versioning Strategy
- URL versioning strategy as shown in `/api/v1`.

### Middleware Organization
- **Middlewares:** Authentication, authorization, request validation, error handling.
- **Implementation:** Use Express.js middleware patterns for modularity.

### Detailed Route Handlers
- Use controllers for route handlers with clear separation of business logic.

## 2. Database Schema Design

### ORM Integration
- **Prisma ORM** for database interactions.

### Connection Optimization
- Use connection pooling with a library like `pg-pool`.

### Transaction Management
- Managed through Prismaâ€™s transaction API.

### Query Optimization Strategies
- Use indexes, analyze query plans, and optimize complex queries.

### Migration Approach
- **Prisma Migrate** for database schema migrations.

## 3. Authentication/Authorization Approach

### JWT Implementation
- Use JWT for stateless authentication.
- Store JWT secret in environment variables.

### OAuth 2.0 Integration
- Optional integration for third-party authentication.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implement using middleware to check user roles.

### Session Management
- Stateless with JWT; sessions not stored server-side.

### Refresh Token Strategies
- Implement refresh tokens for long-lived sessions.

## 4. Error Handling Strategy

### Centralized Error Handling
- Use a global error handling middleware in Express.

### Custom Error Classes
- Define custom error classes to handle different error types.

### Logging and Monitoring
- Integrate with a logging service like Winston and monitoring with Prometheus.

### User-Friendly Error Responses
- Send meaningful error messages with HTTP status codes.

### Error Recovery Mechanisms
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors.

## 5. Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategies
- Use **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data.

### Rate Limiting
- Implement using libraries like `express-rate-limit`.

### Database Connection Pooling
- Configure PostgreSQL connection pooling.

### Query Optimization Techniques
- Use EXPLAIN to understand query performance and optimize accordingly.

### Horizontal Scaling Approaches
- Deploy applications in a load-balanced environment.

## 6. Security Implementations

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- Use libraries like `express-validator` for input validation.

### CSRF Protection
- Use CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.

### CORS Configuration
- Configure CORS to allow specific origins and methods.

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Use parameterized queries through Prisma.

### XSS Protection Strategies
- Sanitize user input and use security headers.

### Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection
- Implement rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks.

### Data Encryption
- Use SSL/TLS for data in transit and encrypt sensitive data at rest.

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Use `Jest` for unit testing of individual components.

### Integration Testing
- Use `Supertest` for testing API endpoints.

### End-to-End Testing
- Use `Cypress` for comprehensive application testing.

### Mock Frameworks and Tools
- Use `Sinon.js` for mocking dependencies in tests.

## 8. Deployment and DevOps

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- Use **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins** for continuous integration and deployment.

### Environment Configuration Management
- Use `dotenv` and environment variables for configuration.

### Containerization
- Use Docker for containerizing the application.

### Infrastructure as Code
- Use Terraform for managing infrastructure as code.

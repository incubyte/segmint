- Implement unit tests using Jest with 90% coverage target.

### Integration and End-to-End Testing
- Utilize Cypress for integration and end-to-end tests.

### Performance and Security Testing
- Load testing with Gatling and security audits with OWASP ZAP.

### User Acceptance Testing
- Conduct UAT sessions with target users before major releases.

## Multi-Environment Deployment Strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

### Containerization and IaC
- Use Docker for containerization and Terraform for infrastructure automation.

### Deployment Workflows
- Dev → Staging → Production with blue-green deployment for risk mitigation.

## Risk Management Plan

### Potential Risks
